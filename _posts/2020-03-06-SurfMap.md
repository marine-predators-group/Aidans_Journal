I began working by following the tutorial series by Moreno and Basille
[Drawing_beautiful_maps_programmatically_with_R_sf_and_ggplot2](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html)


After I felt confident with the code and packages introduced in this series, I storated manipulating the PSAT and track data

---

I began with the Sub_Adult group because it is the smallest. I used the following code to create a new data frame with the track data for individuals 100976 and 95875
```r
uno <- filter(all_sword_hmmoce_locs, all_sword_hmmoce_locs$ptt == "95975")
dos <- filter(all_sword_hmmoce_locs, all_sword_hmmoce_locs$ptt == "100976")

SubA <- rbind(uno, dos)

```
Next, I went through my DSU. data frames and created a vector with the number of times each individual was recorded at the surface each day, in the same order as the days appeared in the new SubA data frame. After this was done, I went back and multiplied the time resolution by the number of observations for each day, such that each value in the vector now represented the number of minutes spent at the surface on that day
``r
minutes <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           10, 20, 10, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 20, 40, 
           30, 30, 30, 20, 10, 110, 100, 0, 220, 170, 200, 150, 270, 60,
           110, 0, 0, 80, 0, 0, 280, 0, 160, 0, 140, 
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
         140, 
         0, 
         0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
           0, 0, 217.5, 240, 195, 37.5, 30, 0, 97.5, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 187.5, 
           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
           
```
I stored this vector as a new column in the data frame. I also created another column with the same information converted from minutes into hour units.

Finally, I used the tutorial code from earlier as a reference to write the code for a map displaying surface use by location among sub-adult swords
```r
ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf(fill = "antiquewhite") +
  geom_point(data = SubA, aes(lon, lat, fill = ptt, size = hours), shape = 23, na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_point(data =  SubB, aes(lon, lat, color = ptt), size = 3, shape = 23, fill = NA, alpha = 0.25) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = -57, y = 34, label = "Atlantic Ocean", fontface = "italic", color = "grey22", size = 5) +
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", width_hint = 0.5) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-82, -50), ylim = c(15,45), expand = FALSE) +
  xlab("Longitude") +
  ylab("Latitude") +
  ggtitle("Surface locations among sub adult swords") +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = gray(0.5), linetype = "blank", size = 0.5), panel.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue"))
  
```
This is the resulting product:
! [SA_SurfMap](https://github.com/marine-predators-group/Aidans_Journal/blob/master/images/SA_SurfMap.png?raw=true)

I repeated this process with the Juveniles and Adults to produce these figures;
Juvenile
! [J_SurfMap](https://github.com/marine-predators-group/Aidans_Journal/blob/master/images/A_SurfMap.png?raw=true)
Adult
! [A_SurfMap](https://github.com/marine-predators-group/Aidans_Journal/blob/master/images/A_SurfMap.png?raw=true)

One thing to note in that it is still unclear where to draw the surface cut-off with regard to individual 110496. The data for this individual appears much different in the figures which could be because: 

1. I am using a cut-off that is too deep and accidently including times when the individual was not actually at the surface.

2. The data is accurate (but perhaps not necessarily representative) and the surface trips occur frequently but for short durations that are not captured at the 5-10 minute resolution of the other tags.

#### GOALS

1. Continue working to develop inset plots for location and time of day
2. Compare surface use accross month (in making these plots, I noticed a pattern of particularly heavy surface use around December - February)
3. Look for packages that contain bathymetric data to layer onto the maps
4. Check ARGOS data for SST data in the areas where surfacing is most common
