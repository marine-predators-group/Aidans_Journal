### Comparing Surface Use by Month (cont.)

Continuing from last week, I folowed the same procedures to generate bar plots of surface use across each month. I realized however, that the graphs did not provide an accurate comparison accross months because of the different number of observations (which consequently influenced the total observed surface time within that month). To resolve this issue, I divided the total number of observed surface hours by the total number of observed days in each month. Therefore, the axis technically represents the total number of surface hours per day; however, this is not an accurate metric because surface use varied significantly between individuals and days.

### Location Track with Seasonal Aesthetic Mapping

To visualize the effect on surface use of the interaction between location and time of year, I decided to revisit my re-plot the location tracks and set the color aesthetic to month:
